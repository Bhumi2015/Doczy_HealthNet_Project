# 🏥 Doczy HealthNet Project

A comprehensive healthcare analytics project focused on validating and analyzing large-scale datasets including **DOFR (Division of Financial Responsibility)** and **Payment Conditions Output**. The project utilizes **Power BI**, **Excel**, **Python**, and **SQL** to automate data cleaning, visualize key healthcare metrics, and assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare data is often complex, unstructured, and filled with inconsistencies. The **Doczy HealthNet** project aims to streamline healthcare data analysis processes through:

- Automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Financial data validation
- Contract compliance checks
- Claims processing insights
- Interactive reporting dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Excel (Advanced Formulas):** VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, conditional formatting
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy):** Data preprocessing, automation
- **SQL:** Data querying, validation, optimization
- **Power BI:** Dashboarding, DAX modeling, data storytelling
- **Textract:** PDF data extraction (DOFR & Payment Conditions)
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## 🔁 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Extracted data from PDFs using Textract
- Converted to structured Excel format

### 2. Data Cleaning & Validation
- Row-wise and column-wise validation for DOFR and Payment Conditions data
- Validated **500+ healthcare documents**, including **contract amendments** and **agreements**, for accuracy and completeness
- Applied Excel formulas and manual review to ensure contract terms, reimbursement conditions, and financial responsibilities were correct

### 3. Data Quality Checks
- Performed rigorous **data quality checks** to identify:
  - Duplicate records
  - Missing fields
  - Formatting issues
- Used **automated scripts in Python and SQL** to ensure consistency across datasets
- Documented data quality issues and worked with stakeholders to resolve discrepancies

### 4. ETL and Transformation
- Loaded cleaned data into Power BI
- Performed additional transformations using Power Query Editor
- Merged multiple sources, standardized formats

### 5. Data Modeling (DAX)
- Created calculated columns and measures
- Built relationships between DOFR and Payment datasets

### 6. Dashboard Development
- Built interactive dashboards using charts, KPIs, slicers
- Example dashboards include:
  - Financial Trends
  - Claim Approvals
  - DOFR Analysis by Provider
  - Payment Discrepancy Tables

### 7. Team Collaboration & Support
- **Supported team members** in understanding data structure and validation logic
- Provided documentation and walkthroughs to ensure process continuity
- Collaborated with business teams to align data analysis with real-world contract and policy needs

### 8. Report Publishing
- Published dashboards to Power BI Service
- Set up scheduled refresh and role-based access control (RBAC)
